REACT:
*react is a open source library for building UI and it is  developed by FB.
*It is not a framwork.
*It is mostly used for developing UI .The other operations like routing and so on in REACT is done by using other libraries as it has a rich open source eco system.
*React has component based architecture wich makes your application into small parts which can be composed into more complex UI.
*Components also make possible to write reusable code[one artile written in React  can also be written in Angular,Vue etc with right data passing to it] .
*React is declarative[example drawing a landcsape to artist and a child].
*React will efficiently update and render  the compnents.
*Dom updates are handled gracefully in react.

PREREQUISITES:
*open the terminal  and INSTALL NODE
*Type npx i  create-react-app react-app<name of app>(this will create react application with neccessary libraries in the respective folder(react-app)).
*cd react-app and npm start(this will start react in the localhost:3000)
*open react-app folrder usind VS CODE and Remove all the files from SRC folder(so that wee can create our required app).
NOTE:
Babel dependecy is used to convert JSX in to JS which the browser can easily understand.
Webpack is used to bind all the dependencies

JSX:

JavaScript XML (JSX)- Extension to the JavaScript language syntax.

Write XML-like code for elements and components.

JSX tags have a tag name, attributes, and children.

JSX is not a necessity to write React applications.

JSX makes your react code simpler and elegant.

JSX ultimately transpiles to pure JavaScript which is understood by the browsers.

JSX differences:

Class -> className
for -> htmlFor
camelCase property naming convention
onclick -> onClick
tabindex -> tablndex

Functional Components:
They are just JS Functions that accepts inputs and returns HTML(JSX) which describes UI.

        ADVANTAGES:
            Absence of "this" keyword

Class Components:
They are ES6 classes that extends component class from the React Libraries.
It must require the Render Method that returns the HTML.
ADVANTAGES:
Maintain their own Private data-STATE
Provides life cycle hooks

PROPS VS STATES

Props:

props are nothing but the properties is optional inputs that component can accept and allows the component to be dyanamic

props are Immutable

Function Parameters

props get passed to the component

props-Functional components

this.props-Class components

States:

States is simply a data  that is to be displayed when the component is rendered and render is responsible for describing what the UI should look like is.The output of render method is a react element(VIRTUAl DOM) which is a plain JS object that maps to DOM Element.STATES can change its values too.

States are Mutable(changed)

variables decalred in function body

state is managed within the component

useStateHook- Functional Component

this.state-class Component

Remember while using SetState:

To change state "setstate" has to be used.

Always make use of SetStates and never modify the state directly.

code that has to be executed after the state has been updated, then place that code in the call back function which is the second argument to the setstate method.

when you have to update state based on previous state value,pass in a function as argument of the regular object.

Event Handler Bindings Methods:

1(refer EventBinding file):This Method every update to the state will cause component to rerender this inturn will generate a new eventhandler for every renders ...for small apps,the performance will not be affected but it is vice versa for big apps and for the components that contain nested child components.

2:Arrow Function(refer EventBinding file):It is similar to the previous method that has some performance simplifications in some scenerios .

3:Binding Event handlers In Constructor(refer EventBinding file).

4:Arrow Function As Class Property(refer EventBinding file):Not yet Released in React.Under Development.
